### Prototype 1: Simple Procedurally-Generated Game

A simple game where a character navigates through a terrain with objects and water.
Has the following features:
- Character movement with arrow keys or WASD
- Collision detection with water and objects (work in progress)
- Randomly generated terrain with clusters of water (work in progress)
- Randomly generated objects with collision detection (work in progress)

Original sprite movement code from Dr. Byron DeVries.
Modified by me (Marcos Sanson) to add different features.

Original art, sprites, and images from Game Endeavor's Mystic Woods downloadable asset pack (Free Version):
